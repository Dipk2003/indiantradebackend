## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites Setup (15-30 minutes)
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
pip install awscli awsebcli

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
```

### 2. AWS Resources Setup (30-45 minutes)
- [ ] Create RDS PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Create S3 bucket for file storage
- [ ] Set up IAM roles and security groups
- [ ] Request SSL certificate (if using custom domain)

### 3. Deploy Application (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x deploy-to-aws-eb.sh
./deploy-to-aws-eb.sh
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables (10-15 minutes)
- [ ] Set database connection details
- [ ] Configure JWT secret key
- [ ] Set up email credentials
- [ ] Add payment gateway keys
- [ ] Configure S3 bucket name
- [ ] Set API keys for external services

### 5. Post-Deployment Testing (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `/actuator/health`
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Test email sending functionality
- [ ] Test file upload/download
- [ ] Test payment gateway integration
- [ ] Test API endpoints with frontend

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Database Security
- RDS security group restricts access to EB instances only
- Strong password policy enforced
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit

### Application Security
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- CORS properly configured for frontend domains
- Sensitive data in environment variables
- HTTPS enforcement with SSL certificates

### AWS Security
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- S3 bucket policies restrict access to application only
- Security groups follow principle of least privilege

## 📊 Performance Configuration

### JVM Optimization
- **Heap Size**: 2GB (512MB min, 2GB max)
- **Garbage Collection**: G1GC with optimized settings
- **Memory Management**: String deduplication enabled

### Auto Scaling
- **Min Instances**: 1
- **Max Instances**: 4
- **Instance Type**: t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Scaling Triggers**: CPU-based scaling

### Database Optimization
- Connection pooling with HikariCP
- Optimized JPA/Hibernate settings
- Query optimization with proper indexing

## 🔍 Monitoring and Observability

### Health Monitoring
- Application health endpoint: `/actuator/health`
- AWS CloudWatch integration
- Enhanced health reporting in Elastic Beanstalk

### Logging
- Centralized logging with CloudWatch
- Application logs accessible via `eb logs`
- Configurable log levels for different components

### Metrics
- JVM metrics monitoring
- Database connection pool metrics
- Response time and error rate tracking

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Monthly)

### Development Environment
- **EB Environment**: ~$15-25/month (t3.micro)
- **RDS (db.t3.micro)**: ~$15-20/month
- **S3 Storage**: ~$1-5/month
- **Total**: ~$31-50/month

### Production Environment
- **EB Environment**: ~$50-80/month (t3.medium)
- **RDS (db.t3.small)**: ~$25-35/month
- **S3 Storage**: ~$5-15/month
- **Load Balancer**: ~$20/month
- **Total**: ~$100-150/month

## ⚡ What You Need Ready

1. **AWS RDS Connection Details:**
   - Database host (your RDS endpoint)
   - Database name
   - Username & password
   - Port (usually 5432)

2. **PostgreSQL Client Installed**
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
   - Make sure `psql` command works

## 🎯 After Running the Fix

1. **Restart your AWS application:**
   ```bash
   eb restart
   ```

2. **Check logs for success:**
   ```bash
   eb logs --all
   ```

3. **Verify it's working:**
   - Visit: `http://your-app-url/actuator/health`
   - Should show "UP" status

## 💡 What This Fix Creates

✅ **`buyers` table** (the missing table causing your error)  
✅ **All user/company tables** (`users`, `companies`, `vendors`, `admins`)  
✅ **Product catalog** (`categories`, `products`, `product_images`)  
✅ **E-commerce tables** (`orders`, `cart`, `payments`, `invoices`)  
✅ **Support system** (`tickets`, `chats`, `notifications`)  
✅ **Analytics & reporting** tables  
✅ **Initial data** (admin user, default categories)  
✅ **Proper indexes** for performance  
✅ **Foreign key relationships**  

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Can't connect to database?**
   - Check your RDS security group
   - Verify your IP is whitelisted
   - Test connection with pgAdmin or similar tool

2. **Permission denied?**
   - Use the master database user
   - Ensure user has CREATE TABLE permissions

3. **Still getting errors after deployment?**
   - Make sure you deployed to the correct database
   - Restart your application completely
   - Check environment variables in AWS EB

## 🔧 Alternative Approaches

**Minimal Fix (just buyers table):**
```bash
psql -h your-rds-host -U username -d database -f create_buyers_table.sql
```

**Manual SQL execution:**
1. Connect to your database with any PostgreSQL client
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database_schema_initialization.sql`
3. Execute the script

## 📞 Quick Support

**Common Issues:**
- `psql: command not found` → Install PostgreSQL client
- `Connection refused` → Check RDS security groups
- `Authentication failed` → Verify username/password
- `Permission denied` → Use database master user

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Script completes without errors
- ✅ Application starts successfully on AWS
- ✅ No more "relation does not exist" errors
- ✅ Health endpoint returns "UP"

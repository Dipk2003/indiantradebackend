# Enhanced Chatbot Integration

## Overview
Your iTech backend now includes advanced AI-powered chatbot functionality with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration.

## New Features Added

### ü§ñ OpenAI Integration
- **Advanced AI Responses**: For queries that don't match predefined patterns, the chatbot now uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent responses
- **Natural Language Processing**: Better understanding of complex user queries
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: More natural and helpful interactions

### üîß New Components Added

#### 1. OpenAiService
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/itech/itech_backend/service/OpenAiService.java`
- **Features**:
  - GPT-3.5-turbo integration
  - Configurable temperature and model settings
  - Error handling and fallback responses
  - System prompts for vendor/product recommendations

#### 2. Enhanced ChatbotService
- **Enhanced with**:
  - OpenAI fallback for unrecognized queries
  - `startSession()` method for session initialization
  - Improved response generation logic

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

#### OpenAI Settings (in `application.properties`)
```properties
# OpenAI Configuration
openai.api.key=${OPENAI_API_KEY:your-openai-api-key-here}
openai.api.url=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your own OpenAI API key.

## How It Works

### 1. Query Processing Flow
```
User Message ‚Üí Pattern Matching ‚Üí Response Generation
    ‚Üì
    Product Query? ‚Üí Vendor Recommendations
    ‚Üì
    Service Query? ‚Üí Service Provider Recommendations  
    ‚Üì
    Greeting? ‚Üí Welcome Message
    ‚Üì
    Help Query? ‚Üí Help Instructions
    ‚Üì
    Other? ‚Üí OpenAI GPT Response ‚ú® (NEW!)
```

### 2. Predefined Patterns Still Supported
- **Product Queries**: "product", "item", "buy", "purchase", "price", "cost", "sell", "selling", "available", "stock"
- **Service Queries**: "service", "provider", "company", "business", "offer", "provides", "specializes", "expert", "professional"
- **Greetings**: "hi", "hello", "hey", "good morning", "good afternoon", "good evening"
- **Help Queries**: "help", "assist", "support", "how to", "what can", "options", "menu"

### 3. AI-Enhanced Responses
For any query that doesn't match the above patterns, the chatbot now uses OpenAI to generate contextually appropriate responses focused on vendor and product recommendations.

## API Endpoints

All existing endpoints remain the same:

- `POST /api/chatbot/chat` - Send a message to the chatbot
- `POST /api/chatbot/start-session` - Start a new chat session
- `GET /api/chatbot/history/{sessionId}` - Get chat history
- `GET /api/chatbot/health` - Health check

### Admin Endpoints:
- `GET /admin/chatbot/analytics` - Get chatbot analytics
- `GET /admin/chatbot/conversations` - Get all conversations
- `GET /admin/chatbot/conversation/{sessionId}` - Get specific conversation
- `DELETE /admin/chatbot/conversation/{sessionId}` - Delete conversation
- `GET /admin/chatbot/recent-queries` - Get recent queries

## Testing the Integration

### Sample Requests

#### 1. General AI Query (NEW!)
```json
POST /api/chatbot/chat
{
  "message": "What are the benefits of working with premium vendors?",
  "sessionId": "test-session-123"
}
```

#### 2. Product Query (Enhanced)
```json
POST /api/chatbot/chat
{
  "message": "I need electronics products",
  "sessionId": "test-session-123"
}
```

#### 3. Service Query (Enhanced)  
```json
POST /api/chatbot/chat
{
  "message": "Who provides web development services?",
  "sessionId": "test-session-123"
}
```

## Benefits of the Integration

### ‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience
- More natural conversations
- Better handling of complex queries
- Contextually appropriate responses

### ‚úÖ Improved Business Logic
- Still prioritizes vendor recommendations
- Maintains existing functionality
- Adds AI intelligence as a fallback

### ‚úÖ Scalable Architecture
- Easy to update AI models
- Configurable through properties
- Robust error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **OpenAI API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your API key is valid and has credits
   - Check the `openai.api.key` in `application.properties`

2. **Network Issues**
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check firewall settings for outbound HTTPS requests

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan
   - The service includes error handling for API failures

### Fallback Behavior
If OpenAI service fails, the chatbot will return: "Sorry, I couldn't understand that." and continue working with predefined patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Replace OpenAI API Key**: Update with your own API key in production
2. **Test All Scenarios**: Verify both AI responses and vendor recommendations
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track OpenAI API usage and costs
4. **Customize System Prompts**: Modify the system prompt in OpenAiService for your specific use case

Your chatbot is now significantly more intelligent and capable of handling a wide variety of user queries!

# B2B Platform Backend

## Overview

This backend serves as the core for a B2B platform, facilitating various operations such as product management, order processing, user authentication, and communication.

### Key Components

- **Configuration (config):** 
  - Handles setup for the database, security, web client, and environment-based configurations.
  
- **Controllers (controller):** 
  - The entry point for API requests, they orchestrate calls to service classes and manage request and response lifecycle.

- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** 
  - Simplify the process of moving data across different parts of the application, providing structure to request and response payloads.

- **Models:** 
  - Direct representations of data structures and schemas used within the database.

- **Repositories:** 
  - Abstracts and handles data operations such as retrieval, storage, update, and deletion.

- **Services:** 
  - Implements business logic after receiving requests from controllers and uses repositories to manipulate data.

- **Utilities:** 
  - Offers helper methods and common functionality used across different parts of the application.

### Business Logic

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Ensure secure access using JWT-based token authentication, managed by the `AuthService` and `SecurityConfig`.

- **Product Management:**
  - Handled by `ProductService`, this includes product creation, management, and categorization.

- **Order Handling:**
  - `OrderService` deals with processing customer orders, including payment integration and order lifecycle management.

- **User and Vendor Management:**
  - Managed by `UserService` and `VendorsService` for actions related to registration, profile management, and vendor services.

- **Communication Management:**
  - Chat-based interactions are facilitated by `ChatbotService` for real-time support and query handling.

### Workflow

1. **Incoming Requests:**
   - Managed by controllers based on defined API routes.

2. **Business Processing:**
   - Controllers delegate to services for core business logic.

3. **Data Operations:**
   - Services interact with repositories to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Response Handling:**
   - Final responses are assembled and returned by controllers.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the standard steps to set up a Spring Boot application. Ensure you have connected to the required database and adjust configurations as necessary.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate into the directory
cd itech-backend

# Adjust configurations if necessary

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Further Enhancements

Improvements may focus on integrating advanced features like analytics for business performance, extended vendor services, and enhanced security protocols.

# Authentication Issue Fix - Vendor Dashboard

## Problem Summary
The issue was that when vendors clicked "Add Product" in the vendor dashboard, they were being logged out instead of being able to add products. This was caused by several authentication and authorization problems.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Security Configuration Problem
- The `/api/dashboard/**` endpoints were set to `permitAll()` which conflicted with the actual authentication requirements
- The `ProductController` endpoints required authentication but the security config wasn't properly aligned

### 2. JWT Token Validation Issues
- The JWT filter wasn't handling token validation failures gracefully
- No proper error handling for expired or invalid tokens

### 3. Controller Authentication Issues
- The `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('VENDOR')")` annotation was commented out in the `addProduct` method
- The `getVendorProducts` method had fallback logic that bypassed proper authentication

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed SecurityConfig.java
- Removed `/api/dashboard/**` from `permitAll()` endpoints
- This ensures proper authentication is required for protected vendor endpoints

### 2. Fixed ProductController.java
- Re-enabled `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('VENDOR')")` for `addProduct` method
- Improved error handling for missing JWT tokens
- Fixed `getVendorProducts` method to require proper authentication
- Added proper HTTP status codes for authentication failures

### 3. Improved JWT Filter
- Added better error handling for token validation failures
- Added proper logging for authentication issues
- Graceful handling of malformed or expired tokens

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Authentication Flow
```bash
# 1. Login as vendor
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mishra@gmail.com","password":"password123"}'

# Expected: Returns JWT token and user details

# 2. Use token to access vendor endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/vendor/my-products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: Returns vendor's products

# 3. Test adding a product
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Product",
    "description": "Test Description",
    "price": 999.99,
    "categoryId": 1,
    "stock": 10
  }'

# Expected: Creates product successfully
```

### 2. Test Error Scenarios
```bash
# Test with invalid token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Product",
    "description": "Test Description",
    "price": 999.99,
    "categoryId": 1,
    "stock": 10
  }'

# Expected: Returns 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden

# Test without token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Product",
    "description": "Test Description",
    "price": 999.99,
    "categoryId": 1,
    "stock": 10
  }'

# Expected: Returns 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden
```

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Check JWT Token Storage
Ensure your frontend:
- Stores JWT tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Includes tokens in all API requests to protected endpoints
- Handles token expiration gracefully

### 2. Request Headers
Make sure your frontend includes proper headers:
```javascript
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('jwt_token')}`
};
```

### 3. Error Handling
Implement proper error handling for authentication failures:
```javascript
if (response.status === 401 || response.status === 403) {
  // Clear stored tokens
  localStorage.removeItem('jwt_token');
  // Redirect to login
  window.location.href = '/login';
}
```

## Database User Roles

### Verify User Roles in Database
```sql
-- Check user roles
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'mishra@gmail.com';

-- Should return: role = 'VENDOR'
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Authentication failed: No valid vendor session found"
- **Cause**: JWT token is missing or invalid
- **Solution**: Check if token is being sent in Authorization header

### 2. "Access Denied" or 403 Forbidden
- **Cause**: User doesn't have VENDOR role
- **Solution**: Verify user role in database

### 3. "Invalid JWT Token"
- **Cause**: Token is expired or malformed
- **Solution**: Re-login to get new token

### 4. Logout on Add Product Click
- **Cause**: Frontend not sending JWT token or token validation failing
- **Solution**: Verify frontend is including Authorization header

## Backend Logs to Monitor

Enable these logs in application.properties:
```properties
logging.level.com.itech.itech_backend=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG
```

Look for:
- JWT token validation messages
- Authentication success/failure logs
- Role-based access control logs

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** in your React frontend
2. **Verify JWT token handling** in your frontend auth service
3. **Check browser network tab** to ensure Authorization headers are being sent
4. **Monitor backend logs** for authentication issues

The fixes should resolve the logout issue when clicking "Add Product" in the vendor dashboard.
